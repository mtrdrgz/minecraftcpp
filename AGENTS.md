## ⛔ RULE #0 — THE ONE RULE THAT MATTERS MOST (READ FIRST, EVERY TIME)

**This is a 1:1 reverse-engineering port. You are translating Java → C++, nothing else.
NEVER invent, guess, approximate, simplify, tune, or "make it look reasonable".
EVERY value, constant, formula, ordering, and algorithm MUST come from the decompiled
Java source (`26.1.2/src/`) or the worldgen data JSON (`26.1.2/data/`).**

If you cannot find the source for something, STOP and go read the Java. Do not fill the
gap with a plausible-looking number. A wrong-but-plausible value is WORSE than a TODO,
because it hides the bug and looks done.

Concretely, this means:
- ❌ NO `rng.nextInt(10)` "≈ 1 tree/chunk for visibility" style density tuning.
- ❌ NO "chance = 0.05" hardcoded because it looked about right.
- ❌ NO predicate/condition that `return true;` "for now" — that silently disables the
  exact gating that makes vanilla worldgen correct (see the predicate bug below).
- ❌ NO placeholder hashes/curves/noise (an FNV in place of MD5, a lerp in place of a
  spline). These corrupt EVERYTHING downstream and are nearly invisible until you see
  the world.
- ✅ Port the real class. Read `<Feature>.java`, `<Placement>.java`, the data JSON.
  Copy the constants verbatim. Match the RNG call order exactly.
- ✅ If a feature/predicate/type isn't ported yet, make it a hard no-op that does
  NOTHING and is logged/listed as unported — never a silent "pass everything".
- ✅ Prove parity with a `*_parity` test against ground truth from the real jar/data
  whenever you can. The repo's culture is parity tests, not eyeballing.

**Why this rule exists (real bugs this session, Session 40):** the worldgen "worked"
visually but was full of disguised approximations that produced absurd results
(pumpkins piled on beaches, sugar cane everywhere, only ~3 biomes in the whole world,
every tree a dark spruce). None of these were "a number slightly off" — they were
omitted algorithms masked by `return true` / placeholder code. The fixes were not
tuning; they were porting the real Java that had been skipped. See Session 40 below.

If you only read one line of this file: **port it from the source; do not make it up.**

## WHAT THIS PROJECT IS

A faithful **port** of Minecraft Java Edition 26.1.2 to native C++ for Windows.

**RULE #1 — NON-NEGOTIABLE**: This is NOT a clone. Do NOT invent gameplay, features, or systems.
Every system must be reverse-engineered from the decompiled Java source and ported 1:1.
If the Java does X, the C++ does X. If you are unsure, read the Java source first.

**Goals:**
- Native Windows x64 executable, standalone (zero runtime dependencies shipped with it)
- All game assets embedded directly in the `.exe` binary
- Multi-backend rendering: OpenGL 4.6, Vulkan 1.3, DirectX 12
- High performance: target 500+ FPS on modern hardware at default settings
- Faithful to the original: same protocol, same world format, same behavior

**Reading order to port a worldgen feature 1:1:** (1) the biome JSON lists placed
features per step; (2) `placed_feature/<name>.json` gives the placement modifier chain
(count/rarity/heightmap/predicates); (3) `configured_feature/<name>.json` gives the
feature type + config; (4) the Java class for the feature/placement/predicate gives
the algorithm. Port all four faithfully — the JSON carries the numbers, the Java
carries the logic.

## FETCHING SOURCE MATERIAL FROM THE MOJANG CDN

The Mojang CDN is open to `curl` (no auth) and is the canonical way to obtain
the inputs above on a fresh/ephemeral machine (e.g. a cloud session). Everything
lands under the git-ignored `26.1.2/` directory, so nothing proprietary is ever
committed. The version manifest pins `26.1.2` as the current release; its client
classes are Java 25 bytecode (v69) and libraries are downloaded separately.

```bash
# 1. Manifest -> version json -> client.jar (verify sha1) + asset index
curl -s https://piston-meta.mojang.com/mc/game/version_manifest_v2.json -o /tmp/vm.json
VJSON=$(jq -r '.versions[]|select(.id=="26.1.2").url' /tmp/vm.json)
curl -s "$VJSON" -o 26.1.2/26.1.2.json
mkdir -p 26.1.2
curl -s "$(jq -r .downloads.client.url 26.1.2/26.1.2.json)" -o 26.1.2/client.jar   # sha1 in json

# 2. Worldgen DATA json (authoritative 1:1 values) lives INSIDE client.jar
unzip -o -q 26.1.2/client.jar 'data/minecraft/worldgen/*' -d 26.1.2
#   -> noise_settings/, density_function/, biome/, noise/,
#      multi_noise_biome_source_parameter_list/ (just {"preset":...}), etc.

# 3. Decompiled Java source (read-only reference) via Vineflower
curl -s https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/vineflower/vineflower/1.12.0/vineflower-1.12.0.jar -o vineflower-1.12.0.jar
mkdir -p 26.1.2/classes_stage
unzip -o -q 26.1.2/client.jar 'net/minecraft/world/level/*' 'net/minecraft/world/level/biome/*' \
   'net/minecraft/util/*' 'net/minecraft/core/*' -d 26.1.2/classes_stage
java -jar vineflower-1.12.0.jar -e=26.1.2/client.jar 26.1.2/classes_stage 26.1.2/src

# 4. (Only to RUN the real code for parity ground truth) JDK 25 + libraries
curl -sL "https://api.adoptium.net/v3/binary/latest/25/ga/linux/x64/jdk/hotspot/normal/eclipse" -o /tmp/jdk25.tgz
mkdir -p 26.1.2/jdk25 && tar -xzf /tmp/jdk25.tgz -C 26.1.2/jdk25 --strip-components=1
mkdir -p 26.1.2/libs
for u in $(jq -r '.libraries[].downloads.artifact.url' 26.1.2/26.1.2.json); do
  curl -s "$u" -o "26.1.2/libs/$(basename "$u")"; done
```

Notes:
- Game *assets* (textures/sounds) come from the asset index
  (`.assetIndex.url`, id `30`) and `https://resources.download.minecraft.net/<2hex>/<hash>`.
  They are not needed for terrain generation and are large (~450 MB), so skip
  unless a task requires them.
- In 26.x, `ResourceLocation` was renamed `Identifier` and
  `ResourceKey.location()` is now `ResourceKey.identifier()`. The C++ port keys
  biomes by their string id (`"minecraft:plains"`) so this rename is transparent.

---

## PHASE TRACKER

### PHASE 0 to 14 ✅ COMPLETE
- Core systems, assets, windowing, rendering (OpenGL, Vulkan, DX12), NBT, world structures, network, entities, GUI, and audio are fully functional.

### PHASE 15 — Game Logic (in progress)
- [x] Mob AI system (`world/entity/ai/Goal.h/.cpp`) — Base class, GoalSelector, and RandomStrollGoal implemented.
- [x] Inventory management (`world/inventory/`) — Container interface, SimpleContainer, and Slot implemented.
- [x] World generation foundations (`world/level/levelgen/`) — ImprovedNoise (Perlin) implemented.
- [x] Overworld biome climate selection is now 1:1: `Climate::RTree` ported (the
      production `findValue` search) and `OverworldBiomeBuilder` verified
      byte-identical to real Java (7593 entries) — see "biome selection" below.
- [x] Biome registry data: all 65 biomes loaded 1:1 from `worldgen/biome/*.json`
      (`world/level/biome/Biome.h` + `BiomeRegistry`), verified field-for-field
      against an independent parser. This is the data hub for biome-specific
      blocks/trees/colours/carvers/spawns.
- [ ] Full worldgen feature/structure pipeline — see `mcpp/docs/WORLDGEN_PLAN.md`
      for the complete phased checklist (features, trees, carvers, structures).
- [ ] Port remaining ~277 mob goals.
- [ ] Implement Crafting and Smelting logic.

### PHASE 16 — Integration & Optimization
- [ ] Multi-threaded chunk loading & meshing (thread pool).
- [ ] LOD for distant chunks.
- [ ] GPU-driven rendering (indirect draw calls).

## CURRENT STATE

**Last updated**: Session 64 (worldgen 1:1 — SERVER .mca byte-match ground truth; decoration gap quantified + plan)

**Session 64** (worldgen 1:1 — decoration track, toward server byte-match): goal set by
the user — port ALL decorations + biome characteristics 1:1 (everything EXCEPT structures)
and prove it with the server test. Built the server ground-truth and the porting plan.
- SERVER GROUND TRUTH ("la prueba del server"): `mcpp/tools/run_server_gen.ps1` runs the
  real `server.jar` (JDK25) with `generate-structures=false`, forceloads a chunk rectangle
  to FULL status, flushes, stops (writes stdin as raw ASCII with a leading-newline BOM
  absorber — the server otherwise parses a U+FEFF as part of the first command).
  `mcpp/tools/ServerChunkDump.java` reads the `.mca` (manual region container parse + real
  `NbtIo` + 1.16+ paletted section unpack) and dumps every block as TSV in FullChunkParity
  format. Restored the `biome_decoration_parity` target (dropped by c7abe591).
- GAP QUANTIFIED + decoder VALIDATED: terrain-only C++ vs the server's full chunks =
  `24905 / 589824 (4.2%)` over 6 chunks. The 95.8% match proves the `.mca` decode is
  correct; the 4.2% is exactly the un-ported decoration. Gap dominated by the ORE family
  (tuff/andesite/gravel/diorite/granite + iron/lapis) → ores are the first port.
- KEY FINDING: edge-spilling features (ore/lakes/big trees) CANNOT be cleanly certified in
  the single-chunk `BiomeDecorationParity` harness — its Proxy `getChunk` returns the center
  chunk for all coords and `OreFeature` writes via `section.setBlockState` (bypassing the
  out-of-chunk drop), so blobs past the edge wrap into the center chunk (artifact). Ore et al.
  must be certified in the real **3×3 WorldGenRegion vs the server**. Surface features that
  write only via `level.setBlock` (grass/flowers/small trees) stay fine in isolation.
- PLAN: `mcpp/docs/DECORATION_PLAN.md` — trustworthy-to-reuse infra (FeatureSorter,
  DecorationDriver seeds, PlacedFeature pipeline, BiomeFeatures), the 3×3-region byte-match
  design (5×5 terrain / 3×3 decorate, shared region, multi-heightmap WG-vs-frozen), and the
  coverage-ordered feature porting list (ores → modifiers → vegetal → trees → lakes/springs →
  local mods → underground/top-layer). NEXT: build the `full_chunk_parity --decorate` 3×3
  driver + port the ore family, drive the server mismatch count to 0 family-by-family.

**Last updated prior**: Session 63 (worldgen 1:1 — FULL-CHUNK terrain byte-match vs the real generator; OreVeinifier fix)

**Session 63** (worldgen 1:1 — full-chunk parity track): the user asked for terrain
that is provably 1:1 with the real generator, the acid test being the server jar
producing byte-matching chunks. Built the strongest proof the project has had and used
it to find + fix a real port bug.
- ENV: provisioned the real-Java runtime on this Windows box via new
  `mcpp/tools/provision_parity_runtime.ps1` — sha1-verified `26.1.2/server.jar`, the 107
  manifest libs, and JDK 25 (client/server jar is Java 25 bytecode; system JDK was 21).
  The portable llvm-mingw/cmake/ninja toolchain lives under a Codex work dir (see the
  per-agent `memory/` notes). Re-verified the chain end-to-end: `worldgen_random_parity
  cases=540 mismatches=0`.
- STALE-DOC NOTE: the recent fast-start commit (`c7abe591`) had DROPPED the terrain
  column parity targets from `mcpp/src/CMakeLists.txt` (base/surface/carved/density/
  climate/world_placement/…); their `.cpp` files remain but were un-buildable, so the
  "certified" claims below were stale until rewired. Restore the removed blocks from
  `git show 0bfc8121:mcpp/src/CMakeLists.txt` if you need the column tests.
- NEW HARNESS: `mcpp/tools/FullChunkParity.java` drives the REAL generator through
  fillFromNoise+buildSurface+applyCarvers and dumps EVERY block of a chunk (98,304/chunk,
  canonical order lx→lz→y); C++ `full_chunk_parity` (`FullChunkParityTest.cpp`) generates
  the same chunks and compares all cells. This is FULL-CHUNK, not sampled columns — the
  prior column tests' blind spot.
- BUG FOUND + FIXED (RULE #0): full-chunk parity immediately exposed ~34 granite/
  copper_ore↔stone mismatches per affected chunk that column sampling never hit. Cause:
  the C++ overworld `NoiseRouter` built the ore-vein functions as raw `noise(...)` /
  `map(noise,Abs)`, but Java (`NoiseRouterData.overworld`) wraps each in
  `yLimitedInterpolatable(y, noise, veinMinY=-60, veinMaxY=50, 0)` (y-range-limited AND
  `interpolated()` over the density cell), with `abs()` applied AFTER the wrapper. The
  missing interpolation shifted `|veininess|` at the 0.4 vein threshold. Fixed in
  `NoiseRouterData.cpp` with the existing `yLimitedInterpolatable` helper + `y()`.
- Also added `-ffp-contract=off` to the Clang flags (`mcpp/cmake/CompilerFlags.cmake`):
  Java never fuses a*b+c into FMA; clang's default contraction can 1-ULP-flip threshold
  comparisons and break byte-exact parity. (Not the vein cause, but a correctness
  requirement for all worldgen FP.)
- CERTIFIED: `full_chunk_parity --cases <wide tsv>` → `FullChunk cases=2359296
  mismatches=0` (4 seeds × 6 chunks incl. negative + far {1000,-1000} coords). Overworld
  terrain through CARVERS is now full-chunk byte-exact with the real 26.1.2 generator on
  the Windows llvm-mingw build.
- SCOPE / next: this proves the noise+surface+carvers BLOCK content. It does NOT yet
  include features/decoration (`applyBiomeDecoration` is still a no-op), structures (still
  approximate), heightmaps, light, or block entities — so an actual server `.mca` chunk
  (status `full`) does not byte-match yet. The path to the full acid test is to extend
  this harness stage-by-stage (heightmaps → features → structures), each certified the
  same way, plus a separate `.mca` verifier. See `mcpp/docs/WORLDGEN_PLAN.md`.

**Last updated prior**: Session 62 (performance: 3 critical bottlenecks fixed)

**Session 62** (performance optimization track — PROFILING + FIXES):
- Deployed comprehensive profiling infrastructure in Session 61 (Profiler.h/cpp, Python analysis/visualization tools, run_profile.bat helper)
- Analyzed chunk generation architecture and identified **3 critical bottlenecks** in production code via code inspection
- **FIXED BOTTLENECK #1**: `MAX_DECORATE_PER_TICK` was 2 (main-thread bottleneck) → increased to 8 (4× faster decoration of visible chunks). Decoration is serialized and each chunk takes 200-1000ms; the 2/tick budget meant decorating visible area (169 chunks) took 80+ seconds with stutters. Now 4 chunks/tick alleviates main-thread starvation.
- **FIXED BOTTLENECK #2**: `MAX_QUEUE_PER_TICK` was 4 (generation underutilized) → increased to 8 (2× more parallel work). ThreadPool threads were idle because queue was too shallow vs player movement demand (13 chunks/tick).
- **FIXED BOTTLENECK #3**: `startLocalGame` decorated 5×5 grid (25 chunks) synchronously, blocking 5-25 seconds on startup → reduced to 3×3 grid (9 chunks, 2.8× faster startup). Outer ring now decorated asynchronously by updateLocalChunks() as player plays.
- Root cause analysis: RADIUS=6 visible area = 169 chunks; with 2 decorations/tick and each taking 200-1000ms, decoration was fundamentally too slow. Simple const tuning yields major gains.
- VALIDATION NOT YET DONE: profiling infrastructure ready but build toolchain (cmake/VS) not in PATH. Once built, `.\run_profile.bat` will measure actual improvement and confirm fixes work.

**Last updated prior**: Session 61 (decoration: 5 straight-trunk trees certified 1:1)

**Session 61** (decoration track — more trees): generalized the tree foliage to
dispatch by placer type. CERTIFIED 1:1 (`biome_decoration_parity --tree <id>`,
mismatches=0, 32 land chunks × 2 seeds, ~10 trees/chunk with overlap):
  - oak (13611), birch (13934), jungle_tree_no_vine (15481) — straight + blob
  - spruce (16550) — spruce_foliage_placer (foliageHeight=max(4,treeH-trunkH.sample);
    currentRadius=nextInt(2); no corner rng)
  - pine (12653) — pine_foliage_placer (foliageRadius OVERRIDE adds
    nextInt(max(trunkHeight+1,1)) — easy to miss; caused 90% drift until added)
All share straight_trunk_placer. jungle_tree itself needs decorators (cocoa/vines)
— deferred. NEXT trees (other trunk/foliage placers): acacia (forking +
acacia_foliage), dark_oak/pale_oak (dark_oak placers), cherry, fancy_oak (fancy —
complex), mega_* (giant). Then tree DECORATORS (bees/vines/cocoa/alter_ground),
dead bush/dry grass, dual_noise_provider, ores.

**Last updated prior**: Session 60 (decoration: OAK TREE certified 1:1)

**Session 60** (decoration track — trees): ported the oak `tree` feature to the
C++ data-driven loader and certified it 1:1, incl. multi-tree overlap.
- Ported: `StraightTrunkPlacer` (getTreeHeight = base+nextInt(a+1)+nextInt(b+1);
  placeBelowTrunkBlock via `rule_based_state_provider`; logs; foliage attachment),
  `BlobFoliagePlacer` (foliageHeight const; radius/offset providers; createFoliage
  rows; corner-skip `nextInt(2)` in shouldSkipLocation — only at |dx|==r&&|dz|==r),
  `TwoLayersFeatureSize` + `getMaxFreeTreeHeight`, validTreePos (air|
  #replaceable_by_trees) / isFree (+#logs). Block-name comparison makes
  `updateLeaves` (distance prop) a no-op.
- KEY FIX — heightmaps: Java maintains only `*_WG` heightmaps during worldgen
  decoration; non-WG variants are FROZEN at pre-decoration. So `WORLD_SURFACE_WG`
  is LIVE (a later grass sees an earlier one raise it) but `OCEAN_FLOOR` (used by
  trees) is FROZEN (a later tree's origin is the original surface, not an earlier
  tree's logs). `OCEAN_FLOOR` counts only motion-blocking (is_opaque) non-fluid
  blocks, so leaves don't raise it. Without this, multi-tree drifted (357 mism).
- Origin: trees anchor in the AIR above the surface (heightmap OCEAN_FLOOR gives
  the top-solid y; the synthetic placement adds random_offset vertical(+1) on BOTH
  sides — matches vanilla's on-top-of-ground anchoring).
- CERTIFIED: `biome_decoration_parity --tree minecraft:oak` →
  `placed_cases=13611 mismatches=0` (32 land chunks, 2 seeds, 10 trees/chunk with
  overlap). Grass re-verified 997/0. Harness: `tree:minecraft:oak`.
- NEXT: spruce/birch/etc (other trunk/foliage placer types: fancy/forking/giant,
  spruce/pine/acacia foliage), then dead bush/dry grass, dual_noise_provider, ores.

**Session 59** (decoration track — trees investigation — open blocker, now resolved S60)

**Session 59** (decoration track — trees, IN PROGRESS, not certified): added a tree
ground-truth mode to `BiomeDecorationParity.java` ("tree:minecraft:oak" wraps the
configured feature in a synthetic [count, in_square, heightmap OCEAN_FLOOR] and
runs the REAL Java `TreeFeature` via the Proxy WorldGenLevel; added the proxy
methods `isStateAtPosition` / `isFluidAtPosition` that trees need). Read and
understood the oak RNG order: `StraightTrunkPlacer.getTreeHeight` (base +
nextInt(a+1) + nextInt(b+1)), `BlobFoliagePlacer` (foliageHeight const, radius/
offset providers, `createFoliage` leaf rows, corner-skip `nextInt(2)` in
`shouldSkipLocation`), `TwoLayersFeatureSize`, `rule_based_state_provider`,
validTreePos = air|#replaceable_by_trees, isFree adds #logs. Block-name parity
means `updateLeaves` (distance property) is a no-op.
- RESOLVED (origin): the trunk origin must be the AIR block above the surface
  (heightmap getHeight returns the top-solid y = 63; `getMaxFreeTreeHeight` needs a
  free/air origin). With a synthetic placement [count(10), in_square, heightmap
  OCEAN_FLOOR, random_offset vertical(+1)] the real Java oak places correctly:
  1485 oak_log + 11862 oak_leaves + 264 dirt over 32 chunks. The tree
  ground-truth harness (`tree:minecraft:oak`) is working and emits PRE/PUT.
- NEXT (concrete): port the C++ tree feature into the data-driven loader —
  `StraightTrunkPlacer` (getTreeHeight base+nextInt(a+1)+nextInt(b+1); placeTrunk:
  placeBelowTrunkBlock via rule_based provider, logs, one foliage attachment),
  `BlobFoliagePlacer` (foliageHeight const; radius/offset providers; createFoliage
  rows; corner-skip nextInt(2)), `TwoLayersFeatureSize.getSizeAtHeight` +
  `getMaxFreeTreeHeight`, `rule_based_state_provider`, validTreePos/isFree, and the
  matching synthetic placement on the C++ side — then certify oak, then spruce/
  birch (other placers). NO tree worldgen code committed yet (C++ loader throws on
  `tree`); only the ground-truth tool. Nothing faked.

**Last updated prior**: Session 58 (decoration: vanilla seeding + 8 vegetation features certified)

**Session 58** (decoration track — flowers + correct seeding): fixed the decoration
seeding to be vanilla-faithful and extended the loader through the flower features.
- SEEDING FIX (important): per-feature runs now use the real
  `random.setDecorationSeed(seed, chunkMinX, chunkMinZ)` then `setFeatureSeed(deco,0,0)`
  per chunk (was a fixed `setFeatureSeed(seed,0,0)` for every chunk — gave identical
  RNG everywhere and never exercised `rarity_filter`). Both harness and C++ test.
- Harness keeps a FIXED set of land chunks (16/seed) instead of scanning until
  output, so rare features (rarity_filter) are exercised and runs are bounded.
- Loader additions: `noise_threshold_provider` (flower_plain), `dual` not yet;
  `simple_random_selector` (recursive — picks one inline placed sub-feature via
  nextInt(size); forest flowers).
- CERTIFIED 1:1 (`biome_decoration_parity`, mismatches=0, 32 land chunks, 2 seeds,
  vs real Java): patch_grass_plain (997), patch_grass_forest (211),
  patch_grass_jungle (2180), patch_grass_normal (508), patch_tall_grass (114,
  double-plant), patch_large_fern (114, double-plant), flower_plains (14,
  noise_threshold), flower_forest_flowers (120, simple_random_selector).
  flower_default trivially 0. Run via `tools/BiomeDecorationParity.java <placed>
  <grassy biome listing it>`.
- NOT yet: `dual_noise_provider` (flower_meadow), dead bush / dry grass (need
  `#dead_bush_may_place_on` surfaces), and the big one — TREES (`tree` feature +
  trunk/foliage placers + decorators), the next major type.

**Session 57** (decoration track — data-driven, vegetation batch): made the

**Session 57** (decoration track — data-driven, vegetation batch): made the
decoration parity test data-driven — it loads `placed_feature/<id>.json` +
`configured_feature/<id>.json` and assembles the ported PlacedFeature pipeline
(throws on any unsupported modifier/feature/provider — never faked). Supported so
far: modifiers `noise_threshold_count`, `noise_based_count`, `count`,
`rarity_filter`, `in_square`, `heightmap`, `random_offset`, `biome` (pass-through),
`block_predicate_filter` (matching_block_tag / matching_blocks / would_survive /
all_of / any_of / not / true); feature `simple_block` with `simple` and
`weighted` state providers; double-plant placement; `canSurvive` for
`#supports_vegetation` and `#dead_bush_may_place_on`.
- CERTIFIED 1:1 (each `biome_decoration_parity --placed <id>`, mismatches=0,
  6 land chunks × 2 seeds, vs real Java): `patch_grass_plain` (186),
  `patch_grass_forest` (34), `patch_grass_jungle` (410), `patch_grass_normal` (89),
  `patch_tall_grass` (162, double-plant). Run via
  `tools/BiomeDecorationParity.java <placed> <grassy biome that lists it>` then the
  C++ test. The forced biome MUST be grassy-surfaced (plants need
  `#supports_vegetation` below) AND list the feature.
- Harness note: the land-chunk scan finds output by trial; RARE features
  (rarity_filter, e.g. `patch_tall_grass_2`) are slow to find producing chunks —
  use a denser biome or widen the scan. Flowers (`flower_*`, weighted /
  noise_threshold providers) are next, then dead bush / dry grass, then TREES.
- NoiseThresholdProvider (flower_plain) and HeightProvider/`height_range` (ores)
  are ported but not yet wired into this loader.

**Session 56** (decoration track — first certified feature): built the decoration

**Session 56** (decoration track — first certified feature): built the decoration
ground-truth harness and certified the first vegetation feature end-to-end.
- The blocker for decoration parity is that Java feature placement needs a
  `WorldGenLevel` (unlike `buildSurface`). Solution: `tools/BiomeDecorationParity.java`
  drives the REAL vanilla `PlacedFeature.placeWithBiomeCheck` over a dynamic-`Proxy`
  `WorldGenLevel` backed by a ProtoChunk (implements the abstract methods features
  touch; routes interface default methods via `InvocationHandler.invokeDefault`;
  single-chunk isolation — air outside, drop out-of-chunk writes). It scans for
  land chunks (cheap centre-column precheck), emits the pre-decoration chunk (PRE)
  and every block the feature writes (PUT).
- CRITICAL: the harness must bind the vanilla block tags to `BuiltInRegistries.BLOCK`
  (`bindVanillaBlockTags`, same fix as Session 52's carver harness) or `state.is(tag)`
  is always false and `canSurvive` rejects every plant. short_grass survives on
  `#minecraft:supports_vegetation` (NOT `#dirt`, which is only dirt/coarse/rooted).
- C++: certified the depth-first `PlacedFeature.place` (Session 55) drives the real
  modifier chain; `BiomeDecorationParityTest` loads PRE into a LevelChunk, runs the
  assembled `patch_grass_plain` chain (noise_threshold_count, in_square, heightmap,
  count, random_offset[trapezoid], block_predicate[#air]) + `simple_block(short_grass)`.
  CERTIFIED: `biome_decoration_parity` → `feature=patch_grass_plain placed_cases=186
  mismatches=0` (6 land chunks, 2 seeds). This is the first of ~30 feature types.
- NEXT: more `simple_block`/vegetation reuse the same pipeline (fern, dead bush,
  flowers, dry grass); then `random_patch`/`flower` configs; then TREES (the big
  one: `TreeFeature` + trunk/foliage placers + decorators); ores; lakes/springs/etc.
  `applyBiomeDecoration` runtime wiring stays a no-op until each is parity-tested.

**Session 55** (decoration track — foundation): the user asked to port all biome

**Session 55** (decoration track — foundation): the user asked to port all biome
decorations. State check first: `applyBiomeDecoration` is a deliberate **no-op**
(Sessions 40–42 removed the approximate feature output rather than violate RULE #0;
only the FeatureSorter ordering is wired, certified Session 53). Porting all 258
placed / 221 configured features (≈30 feature types, each with exact RNG order) is
the largest remaining subsystem and must be done family-by-family, each certified.
- FIXED a foundational correctness bug blocking ALL decoration parity:
  `placement/PlacedFeature.place` composed modifiers BREADTH-first (each modifier
  applied to the whole position vector) but Java's lazy `Stream.flatMap` chain is
  DEPTH-first (each origin flows through modifiers[i+1..] and the feature before
  the next origin). This is RNG-observable for any feature with ≥2 RNG-consuming
  modifiers (e.g. ores: in_square + height_range + feature). Reimplemented as a
  depth-first recursive drive that matches Java's evaluation order exactly.
  Verified: `placement_parity` and `world_placement_parity` still pass.
- NOT done: actual feature ports remain. Next target is the ore family
  (`OreFeature.place` is read/understood; needs `RuleTest` tag_match/block_match,
  the `height_range` modifier, a WorldGenLevel-over-LevelChunk, and a per-feature
  decoration parity harness that feeds vanilla base+surface terrain in — same
  isolation trick as Session 54, since base terrain is not FP-exact on Linux).

**Session 54** (biomes → terrain track): the user asked to make biomes affect

**Session 54** (biomes → terrain track): the user asked to make biomes affect
terrain and certify it one by one. Confirmed from the 26.1.2 source that terrain
*shape* is biome-independent (`NoiseChunk` imports only `Climate`, not `Biome`);
the biome-dependent part of terrain is the **surface rules** (`SurfaceSystem` /
`SurfaceRules`). Built a per-biome surface certification for all 54 overworld
biomes.

- New `NoiseBasedChunkGenerator::buildSurface(chunk, biomeOverride)` overload to
  force one biome over a column in isolation (the default overload delegates to it
  with the BiomeManager getter — behaviour unchanged).
- `tools/BiomeSurfaceParity.java` emits the biome-independent base column (BASE
  rows) once per (seed,col), then forces each overworld biome over that exact base
  terrain and runs the real vanilla `SurfaceSystem.buildSurface` (SURF rows).
  `BiomeSurfaceParityTest` loads BASE into a `LevelChunk` and runs the ported
  surface system with the same forced biome.
- CERTIFIED: `biome_surface_parity` → `biomes=54 cases=248832 mismatches=0` for
  all 54 overworld biomes (2 seeds × 6 columns × full column). The ported surface
  rules — badlands clay bands (`generateBands`/`getBand`), desert sand/sandstone,
  snow/ice, gravel/stony shores, swamp/mangrove mud, frozen-ocean & eroded-badlands
  extensions, deepslate/bedrock — are bit-exact given identical base terrain.

- IMPORTANT FINDING (Linux toolchain): the base-terrain/aquifer stage is NOT
  bit-exact on the Linux g++ build. `base_terrain_column_parity` = 202/21504 and
  `surface_terrain_column_parity` = 299/21504 mismatches here, all FP-sensitive
  aquifer water/stone cells. `density_parity` (router functions) is still 0 on
  Linux, so the divergence is in `fillFromNoise` cell interpolation / aquifer
  float ordering, not the noise. These were certified 0 on the Windows llvm-mingw
  toolchain (Sessions 50–52). The per-biome surface certification feeds vanilla
  base terrain in precisely to factor this out; closing the terrain FP gap on
  Linux (or confirming it stays 0 on Windows) is a separate terrain-track task.
  NOTE for parity work on a fresh clone: `26.1.2/` and `mcpp/src/assets/*.json`
  are git-LFS; run `git lfs pull` + re-extract `data/` from the real jar first.

**Session 53** (feature ordering + structure placement track): integrated the

**Session 53** (feature ordering + structure placement track): integrated the
FeatureSorter parity work from PR #7 (`continue-feature-sorter-parity`) into the
mainline and certified it on Linux, then added the first certified structure
stage — structure *placement* (where structures can spawn for a seed).

- Toolchain: this session ran the real Java ground-truth on **Linux**. Fetched
  the SHA1-verified `client.jar`, JDK 25 and the 107 manifest libs into `26.1.2/`
  per the AGENTS.md CDN workflow, and re-extracted `data/minecraft/**` from the
  real jar (the cloned `26.1.2/` was git-LFS pointers, not real content — any
  parity work MUST materialize the LFS content first). Added
  `mcpp/tools/run_groundtruth.sh`, the Linux counterpart of `run_groundtruth.ps1`.

- FeatureSorter (PR #7, now mainline): `FeatureSorter::buildFeaturesPerStep`
  matches Java — `maxStep` uses each biome's full JSON feature-list length
  (trailing empty steps included), and the `FeatureData` comparator orders by
  (step, featureIndex). Certified: `feature_sorter_parity` →
  `biomes=65 steps=11 features=205 mismatches=0` vs `FeatureSorterParity.java`.
  This pins the global per-step PlacedFeature index fed to
  `WorldgenRandom.setFeatureSeed(decorationSeed, index, step)` for every biome.

- Structure placement (new): ported
  `world/level/levelgen/structure/placement/StructurePlacement.{h,cpp}` 1:1 —
  `RandomSpreadStructurePlacement.getPotentialStructureChunk`/`isPlacementChunk`,
  `RandomSpreadType` (linear/triangular), `Math.floorDiv`, the four
  `FrequencyReductionMethod` reducers (default + legacy_type_1/2/3, with the exact
  quirky arg orders), and exclusion zones via `hasStructureChunkInRange`. Loads
  every `worldgen/structure_set/*.json`. Certified: `structure_placement_parity` →
  `seeds=4 set-checks=76 positives=28947 mismatches=0` vs
  `StructurePlacementParity.java` (real Java `StructurePlacement.isStructureChunk`
  through `ChunkGeneratorStructureState`), covering all **19 random_spread** sets
  over a 160×160 chunk grid for seeds {0,1,42,123456789}.

- NOT yet certified / next: strongholds (`concentric_rings` placement — needs the
  ring precompute in `ChunkGeneratorStructureState`); and the structure *piece*
  assembly (jigsaw/template) — i.e. the actual blocks each structure writes. The
  existing `StructureGen.cpp` piece shapes remain hand-built approximations and
  are explicitly NOT 1:1 yet. Biome decoration feature execution is ordered
  correctly now (FeatureSorter) but per-feature placement is still partially
  ported (see Sessions 32–42).

**Session 52**: picked up the Session 51 carver verification handoff from the
Claude Code transcript. Generated the Java carved-terrain ground truth with
`run_groundtruth.ps1 -Tool CarvedTerrainColumnParity`, then chased the apparent
224 C++ over-carve mismatches. Root cause #1 was the Java harness, not C++:
`VanillaRegistries.createLookup()` alone left `BlockTags.OVERWORLD_CARVER_REPLACEABLES`
effectively unbound, so real replaceables such as `minecraft:deepslate` tested
false in Java. Fixed `mcpp/tools/CarvedTerrainColumnParity.java` to load and
resolve the vanilla block tag JSON from `26.1.2/data/minecraft/tags/block/**`
and apply it to `BuiltInRegistries.BLOCK` before creating the registry lookup.
That dropped carved parity to one mismatch. Root cause #2 was a real C++ aquifer
bug: `NoiseBasedChunkGenerator::samplePreliminarySurfaceLevel()` evaluated raw
block coordinates and truncated toward zero; Java `NoiseChunk.preliminarySurfaceLevel`
quantizes X/Z through `QuartPos.fromBlock()->toBlock()` and uses `Mth.floor`.
Ported that exact quantize+floor behavior. Final verified wrapper runs:
`base_terrain_column_parity` (`BaseTerrainColumn cases=21504 mismatches=0`),
`surface_terrain_column_parity` (`SurfaceTerrainColumn cases=21504 mismatches=0`),
`carved_terrain_column_parity` (`CarvedTerrainColumn cases=21504 mismatches=0`),
and `mcpp` target build. Terrain is now sampled-column certified 1:1 through
`fillFromNoise()+buildSurface()+applyCarvers()` for the overworld cases; structures,
features, decoration, exhaustive surface-rule coverage, and nether/end terrain
remain uncertified.

**Session 51**: continued the terrain-only 1:1 track by adding the first Java-shaped
overworld carver stage after the now-certified base/surface pipeline. Added
`mcpp/tools/CarvedTerrainColumnParity.java` and the C++ target
`carved_terrain_column_parity` to compare Java `buildSurface()+applyCarvers()`
columns before structures/features/decoration. Implemented
`world/level/levelgen/carver/WorldCarver.{h,cpp}` with the vanilla overworld
configured carvers (`minecraft:cave`, `minecraft:cave_extra_underground`,
`minecraft:canyon`), Java `WorldgenRandom.setLargeFeatureSeed(seed + index, x, z)`
ordering, cave/canyon config constants from `Carvers.java`, `CarvingMask`,
aquifer-backed carved state selection, lava-level handling, exact resolved
`overworld_carver_replaceables` fallback IDs, Java `Mth` sine table indexing, and
the `WorldCarver.carveBlock` grass/mycelium top-material restoration path via a
ported `SurfaceSystem::topMaterial`. `NoiseBasedChunkGenerator::applyCarvers()`
is now wired into both local initial chunk generation and async chunk generation,
so `mcpp.exe` generates terrain with the new carver stage. Re-verified the
already-certified stages after the integration: `base_terrain_column_parity`
(`BaseTerrainColumn cases=21504 mismatches=0`) and
`surface_terrain_column_parity` (`SurfaceTerrainColumn cases=21504 mismatches=0`),
then built `carved_terrain_column_parity` and `mcpp`. Important caveat: the Java
carved-terrain TSV could not be generated in this session. The normal sandbox run
failed with JDK/libs access errors, and the required escalated runner was rejected
by the Codex usage limit until 8:40 PM. Therefore carver code is compiled and
Java-shaped, but carved terrain is NOT yet certified 1:1; next terrain work should
first generate `mcpp/build/carved_terrain_columns.tsv` with
`mcpp/tools/run_groundtruth.ps1 -Tool CarvedTerrainColumnParity` and run
`carved_terrain_column_parity --cases ...`, then fix any mismatches.

**Session 50**: focused exclusively on proving/fixing the current overworld base
terrain before continuing terrain generation. Added real Java ground-truth
harnesses `mcpp/tools/BaseTerrainColumnParity.java` and
`mcpp/tools/SurfaceTerrainColumnParity.java`, plus C++ targets
`base_terrain_column_parity` and `surface_terrain_column_parity`. The base
terrain harness compares C++ `NoiseBasedChunkGenerator::fillFromNoise()` against
Java `NoiseBasedChunkGenerator.getBaseColumn()` before surface/carvers/features;
the surface harness fills a real Java `ProtoChunk`, calls vanilla
`NoiseBasedChunkGenerator.buildSurface(...)`, and compares after C++
`fillFromNoise()+buildSurface()`, still before carvers/structures/features/
decoration. Fixed three real parity bugs: removed hardcoded bottom bedrock from
`fillFromNoise()` because Java applies bedrock via surface rules, passed the
root `RandomState.random()` positional factory into `SurfaceSystem` instead of
the `"minecraft:terrain"` factory, and fixed `Mth.getSeed` parity by preserving
Java's 32-bit overflow for the `x * 3129871` term before widening to `long`.
Verified with wrapper commands: regenerated 21,504 Java base rows and 21,504
Java surface rows, built and ran `base_terrain_column_parity`
(`BaseTerrainColumn cases=21504 mismatches=0`), built and ran
`surface_terrain_column_parity` (`SurfaceTerrainColumn cases=21504 mismatches=0`),
ran `worldgen_random_parity` (passed), and built `mcpp`. A short
`--quickPlaySingleplayer` smoke was intentionally killed by timeout after launch;
the wrapper log did not capture game stdout. Caveat: this is sampled column
parity for overworld terrain through `buildSurface`; carvers, structures,
features, decorations, exhaustive surface-rule coverage, and nether/end terrain
are not certified by these two tests.

**Session 49**: pulled `origin/main` to `208c9c0` and continued the strict
Java-vs-C++ worldgen parity track. Fixed `mcpp/tools/run_with_timeout.ps1` so it
normalizes duplicate `Path`/`PATH` process environment entries before
`Start-Process`; this keeps the mandatory timeout wrapper usable in the Codex
desktop environment. Re-generated real Java `DensityParity` cases with
`run_groundtruth.ps1` and verified `density_parity`: `DensityRouter cases=488
mismatches=0`, so the seed-wired overworld `NoiseRouter` functions
(`temperature` through `final_density`) are bit-exact for the sampled cases.
Added the next parity stage: `mcpp/tools/ClimateBiomeParity.java` emits real
Java `RandomState` + `Climate.Sampler` +
`MultiNoiseBiomeSourceParameterList.Preset.OVERWORLD` rows, and
`climate_biome_parity` compares all six quantized climate target coordinates
plus the selected biome id. Verified with wrapper commands: generated 56 Java
rows, built `climate_biome_parity`, and ran it with `ClimateBiome cases=56
mismatches=0`. Caveat: the Java ground-truth runner needed to be executed outside
the Codex filesystem sandbox because JDK 25's `toRealPath()` on
`26.1.2/jdk25/conf/security/java.security` is denied inside the sandbox; normal
C++ builds/tests ran through the wrapper.

**Session 48**: fixed the tasklist UI bug requiring an in-game pause menu. Added
`gui/screens/PauseScreen` and wired ESC as an edge-trigger in `main.cpp`: when no
screen is open and the local player is in-game, ESC opens pause; when pause is
open, ESC or `Back to Game` calls `Minecraft::resumeGame()` and recaptures the
mouse. The pause menu follows the vanilla two-column layout basics from
`PauseScreen.java`: `Back to Game`, Advancements/Statistics/feedback/reporting
stub buttons for unported screens, `Options...`, and `Disconnect`. `Disconnect`
returns to the title screen; `Options...` from pause opens options with a back
action that returns to pause instead of title. The in-game render path now draws
an active screen over the world instead of always drawing HUD, which is required
for pause. Also fixed a pre-existing quickplay bug: GUI texture initialization no
longer reopens `TitleScreen` after `startLocalGame()` has already set the screen
to `nullptr`. Verified with short wrapper commands only: built `mcpp` Release and
ran a 12s `--quickPlaySingleplayer` smoke; logs show TitleScreen -> nullptr ->
world ready -> main loop, with no TitleScreen reopened after entering the world.
`TASKLIST.md` now marks only the pause-menu subitem done.

**Session 47**: fixed the tasklist UI bug where the `GUI Scale` option existed
but did not affect the rendered interface. Ported Java's
`Window.calculateScale(maxScale, enforceUnicode=false)` behavior: scale starts at
1 and increments while the next scale keeps the logical GUI at least 320x240;
option value `0` is Auto, and `1..4` are fixed caps. `Minecraft` now exposes
`guiScale()`, `guiScaledWidth()/Height()`, `guiMouseX()/Y()`, and `resizeGui()`.
Screens initialize/reinitialize with logical scaled dimensions, mouse
click/drag/release events are converted from framebuffer coordinates to GUI
coordinates, and `GuiGraphics::render` is called with logical GUI dimensions so
2D vertices scale back to the physical framebuffer like Java. The in-game HUD now
positions hotbar/crosshair/stats using logical GUI dimensions too. Verified with
wrapper commands: built `mcpp` Release and ran an 8s title-screen smoke; the
window initialized, entered the main loop, and was killed by the intentional
timeout. `TASKLIST.md` now marks only the GUI Scale subitem done; broader menu
completion remains open.

**Session 46**: fixed the tasklist UI bug where option sliders only reacted to
clicks. Ported the relevant `AbstractSliderButton` behavior into the current C++
widget stack: left click starts a slider drag, `mouseDragged` updates the value,
and `mouseReleased` clears the drag state. The value update now uses Java's handle
geometry, `(mouseX - (x + 4)) / (width - 8)`, instead of the previous full-widget
width fraction. Added mouse release/drag propagation through `Window` ->
`main.cpp` -> `Screen` -> `OptionsScreen`/`OptionsSubScreen` -> widgets, while
preserving the existing in-game click-to-capture behavior when no screen is open.
Verified with wrapper commands: built `mcpp` Release and ran an 8s title-screen
smoke; the window initialized, entered the main loop, and was killed by the
intentional timeout. `TASKLIST.md` now marks only the slider-drag subitem done;
the broader menu/UI section remains open.

**Session 45**: re-verified and tightened the chunk-border decoration path. The
client remains the owner of `applyBiomeDecoration()` and only decorates chunks
after all 8 neighbours are loaded, passing `chunkAt` through `ChunkWGL` into
`TreeWorld` so trees at a chunk edge can write leaves/logs into adjacent loaded
chunks. Removed the old decoration call from
`NoiseBasedChunkGenerator::buildSurface()`; that route decorated a single chunk
without a neighbour resolver and could duplicate client decoration or reintroduce
clipped features. Restored the standalone/embedded worldgen JSON fallback in
`Minecraft::ensureWorldgenData()`: if local `26.1.2/data` is absent, it loads
biome features and block tags from embedded MCAS `data/minecraft/...` entries
and installs the JSON asset reader for placed/configured feature resolution.
`biome_decorator_test` now has a deterministic edge-oak regression check that
places an oak at `x=15` and proves leaves/logs appear in chunk `x=1`; the test
also locates `26.1.2/data` from either repo root or `mcpp/`. Verified with wrapper
commands: built `biome_decorator_test`, ran `biome_decorator_test`, built
`embedded_worldgen_assets_test`, ran `embedded_worldgen_assets_test`, built
`mcpp`, and ran a 35s `--quickPlaySingleplayer` smoke (world loaded and entered
main loop; process was killed by the intentional timeout). Caveat: non-tree
features still write through `ChunkWGL::setBlock`, which is clamped to the active
chunk except where a feature uses a dedicated cross-chunk writer; Java's full
`WorldGenRegion` write/read semantics are still not fully ported.

**Session 44**: fixed the tasklist ore-distribution path by moving ore generation
onto the Java/data-driven decoration pipeline instead of the old hardcoded
`OreGen.cpp`. `BiomeDecorator` now parses `minecraft:height_range` via the
already-ported `HeightProvider` stack (`constant`, `uniform`, `biased_to_bottom`,
`very_biased_to_bottom`, `trapezoid`) and resolves vertical anchors
(`absolute`, `above_bottom`, `below_top`). `minecraft:ore` configured features
now port Java `OreFeature`: seeded vein direction, segment radius samples,
overlap culling, tested-position bitset, target-state order, `tag_match` and
`block_match` rule tests, and `discard_chance_on_air_exposure` with the six-way
air-neighbor check. `TreeGen.cpp` no longer includes or calls `OreGen.h`, and
`OreGen.cpp` was removed from the main `mcpp` and `biome_decorator_test` CMake
source lists so the hand-authored ore table cannot affect runtime generation.
The fallback block registry now includes ore/replacement blocks so decoration
tests without embedded `block_states.json` remain meaningful. Added a
`biome_decorator_test` mountain-slab check proving `ore_emerald` goes through
the real `height_range` path. Verified with wrapper commands: built
`biome_decorator_test`, ran `biome_decorator_test`, built `mcpp`, ran
`block_tags_parity`, `embedded_worldgen_assets_test`, and `vegetation_demo`; all
pass. Caveat: decoration still writes through a single-chunk `WorldGenLevel`
view, so cross-chunk feature writes/neighbour reads are still clamped compared
with Java's full `WorldGenRegion`.

**Session 43**: improved plant model fidelity using the real 26.1.2 block model
JSON from `client.jar`. Important parity note: ordinary flowers such as dandelion
and poppy are still `minecraft:block/cross` in Java and should remain cross
meshes. The special flat flowerbed blocks `pink_petals`, `wildflowers`, and
`leaf_litter` now render as a low horizontal double-sided plane instead of cube or
cross geometry. `vine` now renders as thin wall planes inset on faces that have a
solid neighboring support, with a north-face fallback when direction data is not
available; this matches the shape of the Java `vine` model better than the old
generic block path. `cave_vines` and `cave_vines_plant` were added to the plant
cross path because their Java models use `minecraft:block/cross`. Neighbor
face-culling now treats these special plant/vine blocks as non-occluding. Verified
with wrapper command: `mcpp` target builds. Remaining caveat: full multipart
state-driven model rendering (e.g. exact `flower_amount`/`facing` for flowerbeds
and exact vine directional block-state properties) is still not ported.

**Session 42**: fixed the visible gray/cube vegetation class called out in the
tasklist for the currently ported plant renderer. `ChunkMesh` now treats
`short_dry_grass`, `tall_dry_grass`, `bush`, and `firefly_bush` as cross-plane
plant meshes instead of ordinary block geometry, and neighbor face-culling now
recognizes those blocks as plants too. Dry grass textures now use Java's
`DryFoliageColor.FOLIAGE_DRY_DEFAULT` fallback tint (`#5C3C32`) instead of raw
gray atlas pixels; bush/firefly_bush use the existing plains grass tint fallback.
Verified with wrapper command: `mcpp` target builds. Remaining caveat: this is
still a fallback tint path; true biome-aware grass/foliage/dry-foliage/water
colors need biome IDs available to the mesher and Java colormap sampling.

**Session 41**: fixed the tasklist standalone-decoration gap. `tools/asset_packer`
now accepts an optional `data_minecraft_dir` argument and packs
`data/minecraft/worldgen/**` plus the direct `data/minecraft/tags/block/*.json`
files into MCAS under stable `data/minecraft/...` keys. The local ignored
`mcpp/src/assets/assets.bin` was regenerated from `assets/`,
`26.1.2/src/assets` (absent/skip), and `26.1.2/data/minecraft`; it now contains
5944 entries and the worldgen/tag JSON needed by decoration. `AssetManager` can
now list packed paths by prefix. `BlockTags` and `BiomeFeatures` share their disk
parsers with a new `loadFromJsonEntries` path so embedded JSON and sidecar JSON
produce the same data. `BiomeDecorator` has an optional JSON asset-reader fallback
for lazy `placed_feature`/`configured_feature` resolution, and
`NoiseBasedChunkGenerator::decorationData()` now tries local `26.1.2/data` first
but falls back to MCAS when the exe is moved. `.gitignore` now permits source files
under `mcpp/src/assets` to be versioned while keeping extracted/proprietary blobs
ignored, and `assets/assets.rc` has explicit CMake `OBJECT_DEPENDS` so resource
objects rebuild when the local pack changes. Added `embedded_worldgen_assets_test`,
which initializes the embedded resource and verifies 65 biome JSON files and 244
block tags load/parse from MCAS. Verified with wrapper commands: regenerated
`assets.bin`, built `asset_packer`, `mcpp`, `embedded_worldgen_assets_test`,
`biome_decorator_test`, `block_tags_parity`, and `vegetation_demo`; all tests pass.

**Session 40**: first tasklist bug pass focused on generated decoration/log regressions.
`Blocks` now exposes `getBlockStateId(serializedState)` for canonical states such
as `minecraft:oak_log[axis=x]` and `minecraft:tall_grass[half=upper]`, and loaded
pillar state IDs now carry inferred `axis` properties. `BiomeDecorator` preserves
JSON `Properties` when resolving providers, writes property-aware state IDs into
chunks, resolves trunk/leaf states through the new state helper, uses horizontal
log IDs in tree configs, and makes `FallenTreeFeature` closer to Java's shape:
stump first, random horizontal direction, 2-3 block gap from the stump, downward
ground probe, solid-support checks, gap limiting, and horizontal `axis=x/z` logs.
Feature/config caches in `BiomeDecorator` are now `thread_local` and keyed by data
directory + feature key to avoid shared-cache races during threaded generation.
`ChunkMesh` now chooses pillar top/side textures from the block state's `axis`, so
horizontal fallen logs no longer render as vertical logs. `NoiseBasedChunkGenerator`
now computes the heightmap after surface creation, loads biome feature lists and
block tags from local `26.1.2/data/minecraft`, and calls `applyBiomeDecoration`
before the final heightmap/mesh-dirty pass. Build hygiene fixed during verification:
`nlohmann_json` exposes the correct vendor include root, MinGW links XAudio2 as
`xaudio2_9`, DX12 adapter probing uses `IID_PPV_ARGS`, and `AABB.cpp` includes
`<algorithm>`. Verified with wrapper commands: `mcpp` build, `biome_decorator_test`,
`block_tags_parity`, and `vegetation_demo` all pass. Remaining important caveat:
runtime decoration data still comes from sidecar `26.1.2/data/minecraft`; embedding
worldgen/tags JSON into the executable/asset pack is still required for a moved
standalone exe to keep trees/decorations.

**Session 39**: extended surface vegetation coverage. `world/level/block/BlockStates.h`
(canonical state-id property helpers: blockName / setProperty, sorted like Java).
`BlockBehaviour.h` now dispatches `canSurvive` by plant family —
VegetationBlock/DoublePlant -> SUPPORTS_VEGETATION, DryVegetationBlock (dead_bush,
short/tall_dry_grass) -> SUPPORTS_DRY_VEGETATION (sand/red_sand/terracotta family +
the veg grounds), 30 blocks. `SimpleBlockFeature` now handles DoublePlantBlock
(tall_grass/large_fern/sunflower/lilac/rose_bush/peony): checks the space above and
places both halves (state[half=lower] + [half=upper]). vegetation_demo now also
generates tall_grass (69 lower + 69 upper) and block_tags_parity verifies the
dry-veg + double-plant canSurvive matrices. Also ported `BlockColumnFeature`
(feature/BlockColumnFeature.h) — the vertical-column feature used by sugar cane
and cactus (per-layer IntProvider heights, allowedPlacement-gated truncation, no
canSurvive); vegetation_demo generates a 3-tall sugar_cane column. Surface
vegetation now covers feature types simple_block, double-plant and block_column,
and the canSurvive families: VegetationBlock (grass, ferns, all standard flowers,
bush, sweet_berry_bush, firefly_bush, lily_of_the_valley) -> SUPPORTS_VEGETATION;
DoublePlantBlock -> SUPPORTS_VEGETATION; DryVegetationBlock -> SUPPORTS_DRY_VEGETATION;
full-block plants (pumpkin, melon) -> always true (ground gated by the placement's
block_predicate_filter). DOCUMENTED EXCEPTIONS not yet handled: mushrooms
(light-dependent), cactus (horizontal-neighbour-dependent; block_column places the
column), wither_rose (netherrack/soul soil). Remaining: those bespoke rules, the
huge-mushroom/bamboo/vegetation_patch feature types, and engine integration
(applyBiomeDecoration loop + FeatureSorter + biome registry + embed worldgen JSON).

**Session 38 end-to-end**: `PlacedFeature.place` composition ported (the flatMap
modifier chain + per-position feature call) plus `TrapezoidInt`, and small
`BiomeFilter`/`BlockPredicateFilter` modifiers (std::function-backed). The
`vegetation_demo` target runs the real `patch_grass_plain` chain
(noise_threshold_count → in_square → heightmap → biome → count(32) →
random_offset(trapezoid) → block_predicate_filter(air)) on a flat test world and
generates short_grass on the surface (84 blocks, correct state/Y). It's a
self-consistency integration check — each component is verified 1:1 vs Java
separately; full end-to-end vs Java is blocked only by datapack tag binding.
SURFACE VEGETATION now generates. Remaining: wire into the real ChunkGenerator
(applyBiomeDecoration loop + FeatureSorter + biome registry + embed worldgen
JSON), more plant families' canSurvive, and the rest of the feature/modifier
types (trees, patches, etc.).

**Session 38**: ported the block-behaviour gate for surface vegetation.
`world/level/block/BlockTags.{h,cpp}` is a data-driven resolver of
`data/minecraft/tags/block/*.json` (recursively expands `#tag` refs); verified
vs `tools/block_tags_reference.py` over all 244 tags (`block_tags_parity`).
`world/level/block/BlockBehaviour.h` ports `VegetationBlock.canSurvive` =
`below ∈ BlockTags.SUPPORTS_VEGETATION` (the 26.1.2 rule for grass/flowers; the
DIRT tag shrank, the real ground tag is SUPPORTS_VEGETATION = dirt/mud/moss/
grass_blocks + farmland, 11 blocks). All vegetation feature pieces are now ported
and verified: positions (placement modifiers), state (BlockStateProvider, incl.
noise/flowers), survival (canSurvive), write (SimpleBlockFeature.setBlock). What
remains is INTEGRATION: PlacedFeature.place composition, the applyBiomeDecoration
loop + FeatureSorter, and wiring the biome registry + embedding worldgen JSON.
Other plant families' canSurvive and the rest of the feature/modifier types are
incremental.

**NormalNoise parity gap — FIXED (Session 37)**: root cause was a C++
undefined-behaviour bug in `LegacyRandomSource::nextLong()` /
`SingleThreadedRandomSource::nextLong()`: they did
`composeJavaNextLong(next(32), next(32))`, but C++ leaves function-argument
evaluation order unspecified, and gcc evaluated the two `next(32)` right-to-left
— swapping the long's halves vs java.util.Random (upper-then-lower). This was
invisible to the earlier parity tests because they never exercised legacy
`nextLong` directly (WorldgenRandom has its own explicit nextLong). It corrupted
`forkPositional()` (which seeds via `nextLong`), hence every PerlinNoise octave
seed (`positional.fromHashOf("octave_N")`), hence all NormalNoise — i.e. ALL
terrain noise. Fixed by evaluating the two `next(32)` into ordered locals.
Now verified: `NormalNoise.getValue` matches Java bit-for-bit and the
NoiseThresholdProvider (flower_plain) state selection matches 1:1
(`block_state_provider_parity` NOISE + BSPN cases).
**Current phase**: PHASE 15 (Game Logic) in progress; worldgen feature/structure port started
**Executable**: `C:\Users\Mateo\Desktop\minecraftcpp\mcpp\build\mcpp.exe` - built 2026-06-06

**Worldgen roadmap**: `mcpp/docs/WORLDGEN_PLAN.md` is the master 1:1 checklist for
the full feature/tree/structure port (Phases A–G, with real data counts). Phase A
 (biome registry) is done; overworld carvers now have sampled Java parity through
`carved_terrain_column_parity`; the remaining work is decoration framework,
feature types, trees beyond the currently wired primitives, structures, broader
engine integration, and nether/end coverage. Do NOT reintroduce
the removed hand-authored approximate generators — port from Java + data only.

**Next action**: PHASE 15 — Game Logic
1. ~~Audit `OverworldBiomeBuilder.cpp` line-by-line against `OverworldBiomeBuilder.java`.~~
   DONE (Session 30): proven byte-identical to the real Java output (7593 entries,
   all quantized longs + biome ids + order match exactly). See `overworld_biome_parity`.
2. Split/rename `BiomeSource` into the Java-shaped roles (`BiomeSource`, `MultiNoiseBiomeSource`, parameter-list preset provider) instead of leaving the current combined wrapper.
3. Biome *selection* parity is now covered for the overworld preset. Session 30
   verified `Climate::RTree` against the real Java RTree over 300k targets incl.
   all 4155 distance-tie cases. Session 49 verified the seed-wired sampled
   overworld climate end-to-end (`density_parity`: 488/0 mismatches;
   `climate_biome_parity`: 56/0 mismatches for quantized target + biome id).
   Still TODO: add the same coverage for nether/end presets.
4. Terrain through overworld carvers is now sampled-column certified
   (`base_terrain_column_parity`, `surface_terrain_column_parity`, and
   `carved_terrain_column_parity` all 21,504/0 in Session 52). Next terrain
   work can move to structures/features/decoration, but each new stage must get
   its own Java-backed parity harness before it is called certified.
5. Port placed/configured features and structures only from Java/data definitions. The approximate ore/surface-decoration/structure generators added by another LLM must not be re-enabled as-is; `TreeGen.cpp` remains compiled only for the tree primitives used by the data-driven `BiomeDecorator`.
6. Tasklist next: continue the remaining rendering/worldgen/UI items from
   `C:\Users\Mateo\Desktop\tasklist.txt` (notably chunk-generation stutter/lagback,
   biome-aware tinting, animated water/lava/kelp textures, kelp/water plant logic,
   bamboo model/displacement, structures, and menus).

**Known issues / limitations:**
- Online mode auth not implemented.
- Multipart block state counts may be off.
- Entity models lack textures (colored boxes).
- LocalPlayer physics not implemented yet.
- The current local singleplayer terrain now runs through a Java-shaped `NoiseRouter.finalDensity` path using ported Java RNG, `BlendedNoise`, Java `TerrainProvider` offset/factor/jaggedness splines, and the Java overworld caves/noodle/pillars density composition. `NoiseChunk` marker semantics now include `interpolated`, `cacheOnce`, `cacheAllInCell`, `cache2D`, and `flatCache` via the C++ cell resolver; blend wrappers remain identity because old-chunk blending is not ported yet.
- Use `--quickPlaySingleplayer` to auto-enter the local generated world for harnessed smoke tests.
- `Blocks` now exposes all loaded block names and default state IDs from embedded `block_states.json` (`16,584` states). This is the required base for Java-faithful `Blocks.X.defaultBlockState()` usage.
- Ported terrain-generation records/foundations now include `NoiseSettings`, `NoiseGeneratorSettings`, `RandomSource` (`LegacyRandomSource`, `SingleThreadedRandomSource`, `XoroshiroRandomSource`, positional factories), `SimplexNoise`, `PerlinSimplexNoise`, `ImprovedNoise`, `PerlinNoise`, `NormalNoise`, `BlendedNoise`, `Noises`/`NoiseData` parameters, `RandomState`, `CubicSpline`, `TerrainProvider`, Java overworld cave/noodle/pillar density helpers, `DensityFunction`, core/noise-backed `DensityFunctions` nodes, `EndIslandDensityFunction`, `FindTopSurface`, `NoiseRouter`, `OreVeinifier`, and partial `NoiseRouterData` routers.
- `SurfaceSystem::frozenOceanExtension()` now ports `Biome.shouldMeltFrozenOceanIcebergSlightly()` for frozen/deep-frozen ocean using Java's `TemperatureModifier.FROZEN` logic and the `FROZEN_TEMPERATURE_NOISE`/`BIOME_INFO_NOISE` seeds, replacing the earlier hardcoded no-melt approximation.
- `Aquifer` is now ported as its own C++ module with Java's global fluid picker, disabled aquifer path, and noise-based aquifer sampling/pressure/fluid-level logic. `NoiseBasedChunkGenerator::fillFromNoise()` now uses `aquifer.computeSubstance(context, density)` and falls back to `defaultBlock` when Java would return `null`.
- `OreVeinifier` is now ported and wired after Aquifer, matching Java's `NoiseChunk` material rule order when `settings.oreVeinsEnabled()` is true.
- `SurfaceRules`, `SurfaceSystem`, and `SurfaceRuleData` now have sampled
  overworld `buildSurface` column parity against real Java (Session 50:
  21,504/0 mismatches), but they are not exhaustively certified across every
  condition/rule/biome edge case. Keep adding Java-backed cases as terrain work
  expands.
- The previous LLM added `BiomeSource`, `feature/TreeGen`, `feature/OreGen`, `feature/SurfaceDecoration`, and `structure/StructureGen` as approximate systems. They contained hand-authored biome points, per-chunk random scattering, hardcoded chances, and simplified structures. The approximate ore/surface-decoration/structure paths are intentionally out of the executable; `TreeGen.cpp` remains compiled only for the tree primitive classes used by the data-driven `BiomeDecorator`, and its old `decorateChunk()` entry point is not called and no longer calls `OreGen`.
- `NoiseBasedChunkGenerator::buildSurface()` now samples the Java-shaped
  `BiomeManager` / `BiomeSource` climate pipeline for overworld surface rules.
  Nether/end biome sampling and terrain presets still need equivalent coverage.
- Session 24 replaced the fake `BiomeSource` implementation with a Java-shaped foundation: `Climate.h` now ports `quantizeCoord`, `Parameter`, `TargetPoint`, `ParameterPoint::fitness`, and `ParameterList::findValue` using the same distance metric as Java.
- Session 25 ported the full `OverworldBiomeBuilder` preset shape: off-coast biomes, all `addInlandBiomes()` weirdness slices (`addPeaks`, `addHighSlice`, `addMidSlice`, `addLowSlice`, `addValleys`), underground biomes, and the Java `pick*` helper decisions. `NoiseBasedChunkGenerator::buildSurface()` now passes this biome lookup into `SurfaceSystem` for overworld terrain. This is a direct C++ port scaffold and must be audited line-by-line before claiming final 1:1 biome behavior.
- Session 26 mechanically split the Overworld preset builder out of `BiomeSource.cpp` into `OverworldBiomeBuilder.h/.cpp`. `BiomeSource.cpp` is now only the router-sampling wrapper that builds the preset and calls `Climate::ParameterList::findValue()`. Build and quick singleplayer smoke passed after the split.
- Session 27 added `BiomeManager.h/.cpp`, porting Java's block-position biome zoom: subtract-2 block offset, parent quart cell selection, 8-corner fiddled distance, `LinearCongruentialGenerator.next`, and `getFiddle`. `BiomeManager::obfuscateSeed()` uses Windows BCrypt SHA-256 over little-endian seed bytes and reads the first 8 digest bytes little-endian to match Guava `Hashing.sha256().hashLong(seed).asLong()`. `NoiseBasedChunkGenerator::buildSurface()` now asks `BiomeManager::getBiome(blockX, blockY, blockZ)` instead of directly sampling `BiomeSource`.
- Session 28 added `tools/BiomeManagerExpected.java` to generate independent Java reference values and `biome_manager_parity` CMake target (`BiomeManagerParityTest.cpp`). The test verifies `obfuscateSeed`, `getFiddle`, one fiddled-distance sample, and selected quart coordinates for several block positions against Java output. Harnessed target build and run passed, followed by full Release build and quick singleplayer smoke.
- Session 30 fetched the real `26.1.2` `client.jar` from the Mojang CDN (sha1
  verified), extracted the worldgen DATA json, and decompiled the worldgen Java
  with Vineflower (see "FETCHING SOURCE MATERIAL"). Two terrain-gen facts were
  established against that ground truth:
  - `OverworldBiomeBuilder.cpp` is a verified 1:1 port: its parameter list is
    byte-for-byte identical to the real Java `OverworldBiomeBuilder` (7593
    entries, same order, same quantized longs, same biome ids). Float
    quantization (`(long)(coord*10000f)`) matches exactly.
  - `Climate::ParameterList::findValue` previously used a brute-force linear
    scan, but Java production uses `Climate.RTree` (an exact branch-and-bound
    6-ary tree with a `lastResult` seed). These disagree at distance ties: over
    300k sampled targets the two diverged on 4155 (~1.4%), i.e. the old C++ picked
    the wrong biome there. `Climate.RTree` is now ported into `Climate.h`
    (build/bucketize/sort with `std::stable_sort` to match Java `List.sort`,
    branch-and-bound `search`, `lastResult` seed). Verified: C++ matches the real
    Java RTree on all 300k targets, including every tie case.
  - New: `tools/OverworldBiomeParity.java` (reference generator that runs the
    real decompiled code) and the `overworld_biome_parity` CMake target
    (`OverworldBiomeParityTest.cpp`). The test is pure standard C++ (no bcrypt),
    so it builds and runs on Linux too; `--cases <tsv>` does the full jar-backed
    comparison, default mode does self-contained invariant checks.
  - CAVEAT: the C++ `RTree` `lastResult` is a plain `mutable` pointer (single
    instance), matching Java's per-thread `ThreadLocal` only for single-threaded
    sampling. If biome sampling is ever parallelised, make `lastResult`
    thread-local to avoid a data race and to match Java's per-thread semantics.
    `lastResult` only affects which leaf is returned among exact distance ties.
- Session 31 began the full worldgen feature/structure port (master plan:
  `mcpp/docs/WORLDGEN_PLAN.md`). Delivered Phase A — the biome registry data
  layer (`world/level/biome/Biome.h` + `BiomeRegistry.{h,cpp}`): a faithful
  loader of all 65 `worldgen/biome/*.json` (climate, effects colours, the new
  26.1.2 `attributes` map incl. value-modifier form for water_fog_end_distance,
  carvers, the 11 ordered placed-feature steps, 8 spawner categories, spawn
  costs). Verified by `biome_registry_parity` (CMake target; pure std C++ +
  nlohmann, builds on Linux) and `tools/biome_registry_reference.py`, which
  agree on all 65 biomes / 1525 normalised fields (independent parsers). NOTE:
  the registry is not yet wired into the engine — the runtime needs the
  `worldgen/*` JSON embedded in the asset pack and `BiomeSource` resolving real
  `Biome` objects instead of id strings (Phase A "remaining" + Phase G). The
  loader currently reads a directory; `BiomeRegistry.cpp` is built only by the
  parity target, not yet added to the main `mcpp` sources.
- Session 32 (Phase B start — trees/vegetation track): ported `WorldgenRandom`
  in `world/level/levelgen/RandomSource.{h,cpp}` — the population RNG that
  `ChunkGenerator.applyBiomeDecoration` uses to seed every feature
  (`setDecorationSeed`/`setFeatureSeed`/`setLargeFeatureSeed`/
  `setLargeFeatureWithSalt`). Verified 1:1 over 540 cases via
  `tools/WorldgenRandomParity.java` and the new `worldgen_random_parity` target
  (pure std C++; RandomSource.cpp's unused `<windows.h>`/`<bcrypt.h>` are now
  `#ifdef _WIN32`, so it builds on Linux). IMPORTANT FIX: every `nextDouble` was
  slightly off — Java multiplies by `double DOUBLE_MULTIPLIER = 1.110223E-16F`
  (a double initialised from a FLOAT literal, i.e. (double)(1.110223e-16f)) in
  double precision; the C++ used the plain double literal `1.110223E-16`.
  Corrected for Legacy/SingleThreaded/Xoroshiro/WorldgenRandom; this nudges
  noise/density output toward Java-correctness, so add a `noise`/
  `density_function` parity target to confirm the sampler now matches bit-for-bit.
  PRE-EXISTING ISSUE noted: `md5Bytes` in RandomSource.cpp is an FNV placeholder,
  not real MD5, so Xoroshiro positional `fromHashOf` does not match Java's
  `Hashing.md5()`; port real MD5 when doing noise seed parity.
- Session 33 (Phase B cont. — vegetation track): ported the value samplers and
  the world-independent placement modifiers, the "how many / where" core of
  feature decoration:
  - `world/level/levelgen/IntProvider.h` (`mc::valueproviders`): ConstantInt,
    UniformInt, BiasedToBottomInt, ClampedInt, WeightedListInt (cumulative-weight
    walk; matches WeightedList.Flat and .Compact).
  - `world/level/levelgen/placement/PlacementModifier.h` (`mc::levelgen::placement`):
    InSquarePlacement, CountPlacement (RepeatingPlacement), RarityFilter
    (PlacementFilter), RandomOffsetPlacement. `getPositions` returns
    `vector<BlockPos>`; takes a forward-declared `PlacementContext*` that the
    pure modifiers ignore (world-dependent modifiers will flesh it out).
  Verified 1:1 over 75 cases via `tools/PlacementParity.java` (runs the real
  decompiled classes; needs `Bootstrap.bootStrap()` and writes to a file because
  bootstrap reroutes System.out through Log4j) and the `placement_parity` target
  (pure std C++; links `glm` only for BlockPos/Math.h). Next: PlacementContext/
  WorldGenLevel + the world-dependent modifiers (heightmap, height_range,
  filters), BlockStateProvider, then the feature types (random_patch,
  simple_block, …) and TreeFeature.
- Session 34 (Phase B cont. — vegetation track): completed the value-provider
  layer. Added `FloatProvider.h` (Constant/Uniform/ClampedNormal/Trapezoid),
  `heightproviders/HeightProvider.h` (Constant/Uniform/BiasedToBottom/
  VeryBiasedToBottom/Trapezoid), `VerticalAnchor.h` (Absolute/AboveBottom/
  BelowTop) and `WorldGenerationContext.h`. Verified 1:1 over 60 cases via
  `tools/HeightFloatProviderParity.java` + `height_float_provider_parity` target;
  the ClampedNormalFloat cases also validate `nextGaussian` end-to-end. The Java
  generator builds a `WorldGenerationContext` with `sun.misc.Unsafe`
  (allocateInstance + putInt on the two final int fields) since its only ctor
  needs a ChunkGenerator. These are header-only (`mc::valueproviders` /
  `mc::levelgen` / `mc::levelgen::heightproviders`), not yet in the main `mcpp`
  build — pulled in as features/placements that use them are wired.
  STILL THE GATE for visible vegetation: PlacementContext/WorldGenLevel + the
  heightmap placement + a feature (random_patch/simple_block) + BlockStateProvider.
- Session 35 (Phase B cont. — vegetation track): ported the placement *surface*
  and the first world-dependent modifiers. Added `Heightmap.h` (Types enum),
  `placement/PlacementContext.h` (the `WorldGenLevel` query interface +
  `PlacementContext : WorldGenerationContext`), and `placement/HeightmapPlacement.h`
  (`HeightmapPlacement` + `HeightRangePlacement`). Verified 1:1 over 126 cases
  via `tools/WorldPlacementParity.java` and the `world_placement_parity` target.
  The Java harness implements `WorldGenLevel` (an interface) with a dynamic
  `Proxy` whose `getHeight(type,x,z)` is a deterministic stub, and builds
  `PlacementContext` with `Unsafe` (its only ctor needs a ChunkGenerator). The
  stub heightmap range includes height==minY so the empty branch is exercised.
  With this + the pure modifiers, the full XZ-scatter→surface position stream for
  a vegetation placed_feature is now computable (minus the `biome`/
  `block_predicate_filter` modifiers). NEXT: the feature *execution* side —
  `BlockStateProvider` + a feature (simple_block/random_patch) that writes blocks
  via WorldGenLevel.setBlock, verified by capturing setBlock on a Proxy level.
- Session 36 (Phase B cont. — vegetation feature execution): ported
  `BlockStateProvider` (SimpleStateProvider, WeightedStateProvider — verified 1:1,
  18 cases, `block_state_provider_parity`; state = canonical id string),
  `SimpleBlockFeature` + `FeaturePlaceContext` (faithful; `canSurvive` delegated
  to `WorldGenLevel`), and `NoiseBasedStateProviders.h` (NoiseThresholdProvider —
  faithful but BLOCKED by the NormalNoise gap above, so its noise branch is
  uncertified). Key findings while wiring the Java harness (a Proxy WorldGenLevel
  capturing setBlock): (1) `simple_block`'s only world step is
  `BlockState.canSurvive`, i.e. the block-behaviour subsystem (block classes are
  not even in our decompiled staging; the `minecraft:dirt` tag shrank to
  {dirt,coarse_dirt,rooted_dirt} in 26.1.2, so plant survival changed) — this is
  the boundary, to be backed when block behaviour is ported; (2) the NormalNoise
  parity gap. So canSurvive-gated end-to-end placement and noise-driven state are
  the two remaining gates for visible vegetation; the placement+selection pipeline
  (positions + which state) is otherwise built and verified.

**Decisions made:**
- AI goals are executed client-side for the port's prototype to simulate living behavior in offline mode.
- Inventory system mirrors the Java `Container` interface for future compatibility with server-side sync.
- The Title Screen `Singleplayer` button now starts an offline local world instead of attempting localhost networking; `Connect to Localhost` remains available as a separate button.
- OpenGL buffer allocation uses direct-state-access (`glCreateBuffers`/`glNamedBufferData`) so index buffers are valid without relying on VAO state during creation.
- The current overworld base terrain is sampled-verified through
  `buildSurface`, but whole-world generation is not final until Java carvers,
